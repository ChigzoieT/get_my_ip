# Understanding Local and Public IPs: A Guide to Setting Up a Local Server
This post is designed to educate beginners on how to create a local server on their machine and understand the fundamentals of IP addresses.

# Key Topic: Public vs. Private IPs
When connected to the internet, your device is assigned multiple IP addresses. These can be categorized into public and private IPs.

Private IPs are used within a local network and are not accessible from the internet. For example, when multiple devices connect to a router, each device is assigned a private IP from a predefined range (e.g., 192.168.0.x).
Public IPs are assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and are required for communication outside the local network. When accessing the internet, the router requests a public IP from the ISP and manages data routing between connected devices.
Why Are IPs Important?
IPs serve many functions, including:

Hosting local or remote servers for applications.
Enabling real-time communication (e.g., chat, video, and audio streaming).
Facilitating file transfers and other network-based services.
Setting Up a Server and Managing Your IP
If you need a public IP to host a remote server, but do not want to expose your actual IP, you can use a VPN service (e.g., NordVPN) to obtain an alternative IP.
Be cautious when dealing with network security. Misuse of networking knowledge can lead to consequences, as online activities are traceable.
